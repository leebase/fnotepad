# Logging Prompts Workflow

1. For every message from the USER, open `/home/lee/projects/fnotepad/case-study-raw.md`.
2. Append a new section for the prompt.
3. Record the USER's prompt *exactly* as it was written.
4. Record a concise summary of the actions taken or the response generated by Antigravity.
5. Save the file.

This workflow is mandatory for the lifetime of this project to assist the user in building their Antigravity tutorial.
