# Tutorials Index

Learning is a core component of this repository. We've compiled tutorials targeting both the technical execution of Forth and the strategic management of AI partners.

If you are a seasoned software engineer who is interested in stepping outside your comfort zone, these guides are for you.

## 🧭 The Antigravity Collection

* [**Antigravity Programming**](antigravity_tutorial.md)  
  A guide to building software in a language you don't know. Covers the "Executive Model" of AI collaboration, prompt strategies, isolation techniques, and debugging stack traces using our actual project as the case study.

## 💾 The Forth Collection

* [**Forth for Experienced Programmers**](forth_tutorial.md)  
  A crash course bridging the gap between C/Python/Java and Forth. Focuses purely on building a mental model of the stack, direct memory allocation, and understanding postfix execution—enough to read and modify `fnotepad`.

* [**Commented Source Code**](../src/notepad_commented.fs)  
  A highly-annotated version of our editor source code. The comments walk through explicit stack manipulations `( before -- after )` block-by-block.
